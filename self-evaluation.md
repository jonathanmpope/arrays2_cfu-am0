# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

**I feel really good about the each method. It's similar to javascript iteration methods I've used before.**

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

**Productive struggle. I got stuck a few times, but with some googling I was able to find answers fairly quickly.**

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**No changes yet.**

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

**None right now.**
